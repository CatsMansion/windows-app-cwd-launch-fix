rem  WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
rem  --------------------
rem  DyberPet resolves every "res\..." path against the WORKING DIRECTORY
rem  of the process (its settings.py sets basedir = '' on Windows).
rem  If the working directory is not this folder, it crashes with:
rem      FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
rem                         'res/language/language.json'
rem  Double-clicking the .exe does NOT always guarantee a correct working
rem  directory, so this launcher forces it. It works from anywhere:
rem  Explorer, a shortcut, the Run dialog, a terminal in another folder.
rem
rem  Content is ASCII-only on purpose, and saved with CRLF line endings.

rem  /d forces the startup directory of the child process as well,
rem  so this cannot break even if the cd above were ignored.
